### Terminology

1. **Program** – a sequence of instructions (called statements), which are executed one after another in a predictable manner. Sequential flow is the most common and straightforward sequence of statements, in which statements are executed in the order that they are written – from top to bottom in a sequential manner;
2. **Statement** – a single action (like print a text) terminated by semi-colon (;);
3. **Block** – a group of zero, one or more statements enclosed by a pair of braces {...}; There are two such blocks in the program above.
4. **Method** – a sequence of statements that represents a high-level operation (also known as subprogram or procedure).
5. **Syntax** – a set of rules that define how a program needs to be written in order to be valid; Java has its own specific syntax that we will learn;
6. **Keyword** – a word that has a special meaning in the programming language (public, class, and many others). These words cannot be used as variable names for your own program;
7. **Identifier or name** – a word that refers to something in a program (such as a variable or a function name);
8. **Comment** – a textual explanation of what the code does. Java comments start with //.
9. **Whitespace** – all characters that are not visible (space, tab, newline, etc.).
